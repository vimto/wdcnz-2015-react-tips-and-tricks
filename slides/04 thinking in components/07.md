## Component Lifecycle

Note:
So this is the component lifecycle. pretty simple, so worth getting your head around and knowing pretty well.

## Component Lifecycle
`componentWillMount`
- Querying data
- Listerning to Data

## Component Lifecycle
`componentDidMount`
- Accessing the DOM
- Refs and findDOMNode()
- Remember to use isMounted() if async
- Attatch DOM listeners
- Integrate with other libraries

Note: 
We use componentDidMount a bit for DOM manipuation if needed. Even though React manages the DOM, it's sometimes necessary to access the DOM directly. 

To interact with the browser, you'll need a reference to a DOM node. React has a React.findDOMNode(component) function which you can call to get a reference to the component's DOM node.

- isMounted() returns true if the component is rendered into the DOM, false otherwise. You can use this method to guard asynchronous calls to setState() or forceUpdate().


Attatch DOM listeners, as we'll see in the next section.

Integrate with other libraries (Along with componentDidUpdate)


---

## Component Lifecycle
`componentWillReceiveProps`
- Update any state before render kicks in

Note:
componentWillReceiveProps is called when a component is about to receive properties, and useful making any other changes before the render triggers.

---

## Component Lifecycle
`shouldComponentUpdate`
- Useful for tuning performance, more later

---

## Component Lifecycle
`componentWillUnmount`
- Cleaning up
- Removing listeners

## Reuse
- PropTypes + Default properties

[Example of proptypes]

Note:
Since components are intended to be self conatained and discrete, they naturally push you towards reuse.

To help promote this, React let's you define a schema to validate the properties that are passed to a component via propTypes, and some default values, along with warnings to the console in development when the schema is invalidated.

Initially these seemed redundant, and an attempt to drag me from hipster dynamic-language-land back to the corporate world of static typing. 

But at Atomic we've since come to appreciate the structure they provide both upfront in terms of forcing you to think about the data-contract a component has, and as you scale your app to catch type issues early. We've now got linter rules that force you to declare them.

Facebook also has their take on a gradual type system, Flow. This seems really interesting, whilst we've take a look, we haven't started using it internally.

## Reuse
- Mixins
[Code]

Note:
React allows you to define Mixins to let you capture cross-cutting concerns. These mixins can be declared in the definition of a component and hook into  a components lifecycle. 

However these seem to be falling out of favour with the React, as it tries to remove some internal magic from the library in favour of native ES6 constructs. 

The canonical example is a mixin that manages to binding to a store.


We're still using them, but are considering alternatives before creating new ones.

## Reuse
- Higher Order Components

Note:
An alternate approach that we've come across and started to experiment with is higher order components.

The idea here is that the concern to be re-used is captured in a component itself, which simply wraps the component the concern is applied to.

It's elegant, and reminds me very much of the decorator pattern. It does have a couple of trade-offs â€” wrapping components with multiple concerns becomes clunky, and these higher order components can't (by default) don't have access to a components state.

A future option is this direction is native ES7 decorators of course.

## Reuse
- Inheritence

Note:
https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html

Finally, since Components can be declared as Classes, there's always good old fasioned inheritence. We don't really use inheritence. Does anyone any more?

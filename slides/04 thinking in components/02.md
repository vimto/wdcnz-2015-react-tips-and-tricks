## Basics
- Don't Render inside body!


Note:
A few little things we learned as we started authoring components.

Everyone throws up a little in their mouth when they first see HTML in JavaScript files. 

Take a breath. It's OK. It's just JavaScript. 

I'm pretty sure everyone also things about ways to extract the templates back out to a separate file which is definitely doable, but misses one of the main benefits of a component based approach - a seperation of concerns is NOT the same as a separation of technologies, and having the display logic and generation co-located makes for a much nicer development flow.

Use displayName, which you get for free when defining components and assigning them to a variable. This is useful for debugging, in the Chrome inspeactor you saw before, and in other performance based tools that I'll show you in a few slides.

Don't render to body. We did this, and at it resulted in WebFontLoader and React fighting for control over a schizophrenic body tag. I also spoke to Owen recently who spoke about using react to render the entire HTML page in the server. React doesn't really work as an entire templating language.

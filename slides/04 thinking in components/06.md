## Synthetic Events
- Cross Platform
- Autobind `this`
- Smart delgation

Note:
React's Synthetic Event system is great. It normalises events across the browser, takes care of binding scope to any handlers you attach back to the component. 

And it's smart about delegation. Whilst you declare event handelers inline, behind the scenes it uses a top level listener and event delegation to keep things performant.

Note:

There are times we've had to step outside of React's built in event system and listen to the DOM directly.

We have keyobard shortcuts bound to the document, with groups of keyboard shortcuts enabled and disabled via a KeyboardManager which components can communicate with directly.

We bind to certain window events such as resize and mouseup directly, as you can see here.

Finally, there are a couple places where we need finer grained control over image loading, for example when we're providing nice preloaders, or displaying images for upload immediately whilst their data is uploaded. For these we bind directly to the image elements load event.

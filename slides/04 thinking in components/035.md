### Small is beautiful

Note:
One aspect of this I particularly like is the ability to define small pieces of ui as funtions. Since JSX is embedded into the component, and can be returned by any function and not just render, there is very little friction to decomposing further inside components, if it doesn't make sense to extract to a fill component.

You start to think of chunks of HTML as simple functions, which are unit-testable just like any other code.

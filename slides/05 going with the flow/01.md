## Props vs State
- Props
- [Table to compare]

Note:
A source of confusion when we got into components was the diference between props and state.

This was something that tripped us up a bit when we first started writing components.

For a given component, it's useful to think of props as the context — passed in and owned by a component, and immutable. If you think if a component as a function, props might be the arguments passed in, whereas state might be local variables.

If a component needs to persist some local data as part on an interactions, we can store this as mutable state in the component. This state should be private to the component. It's changed only by calling this.setState(), which triggers a re-render. 

And as part of this re-render, some of that state might be passed down to child components as props.

## Shared State
- Find components that render something based on that state<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Find a common ancestor<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Either the common ancestor (or another component higher up in the hierarchy) should own the state<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- If you can't find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component simply for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
Since multiple components might rely on the same data, and state in one component can be passed as props to another component, it may not be immediately clear which component should own a particular piece of data, and store it as state. A few steps to help, lifted from the React Docs.

## Anti-patterns
- Setting state from Props<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Storing derivative data of state<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
A couple of simple antipatterns, which we've deinitely fallen into early on.

Setting state from Props leads to duplication. The exception here is often initial values that are passed down as props, and copied into state that the component then owns.

And storing derivative data. Since React is pretty fast, it's much simpler to calculate what's needed during the render process, than store pre-calculated values. It's best to store the simplest possible values to describe a component’s state

## Controller Components
![Obviously](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/470cd79d56c2db0f6b2af33c614aaf3dbe97d8d1/687474703a2f2f7279616e73756b616c652e636f6d2f76697a2f72656163746a732d666c75782d636f6d706f6e656e74732f666c75785f766965775f636f6e74726f6c6c65722e706e67)

Note:
A pattern that we've seen emerge as we sussis that as state needs to be shared across componenents, it bubbles up naturally to what we call Controller Components or Controller Views or Containers. These ControllerCommponents often form the root of something similar to DDDs bounded context. These ControllerComponents tend to be ones which quuery and own the data, and have a hierarchy of mostly stateless components underneath them.

We have a few of them in our app, The WorkSpace, The Canvas, The Properties Panel, The Toolbar.

General speaking, this leads to a situation where components are mostly state-less, or pure, state aggregating in certain components.

One challenge whith this approach is updating the data? If a nested component needs to update some piece of state that's owned in state higher up the chain. 

In small and specific examples, one solution we use is to define mutator functions in the components that own the state, and pass them down as props alongside the state itself to child components.

This isn't a particularly scalable approach, and a more systematic approach to solving this problem is Flux.

## What the Flux?
- [Diagram]

Note:
When coming from a more traditional MVC approach to React, something comes up pretty quickly is where do I store my data?  Again, another topic that's a talk all on it's own, and the source of much confusion.

Essentially, Flux is the pattern that Facebook uses internally to enforce one way data flow, which compliments React's composable view components.

It's great for being able to reason about your application, and having messages flow through single points such as the dispatcher is great for cross cutting concerns.

When we started down the path of using React, there weren't really any libraries out there, so we rolled our own given how small the pattern is.

---

## What the Flux?
- [Flux libs]

Note:
Since then, it's been become an area of intense development, with plenty of Flux libraries being written with their own distinct take on the core Flux pattern. 

We currently use a library called Fluxxor, which stays true to the original intent of the pattern, whilst offering some syntactic conveniances.

It does have a few shortcomings, — Stores are Singletons which is a bit of a pain for testing, and it wasn't really written with server rendering in mind.

---

## What the Flux?
- Stores and Models 


Note:
Another difference that it took a little while to cement was the difference betwee Stores and Models. 

Stores in the Flux world are responsible for domains of related data, which may comprise of more than one type of entity. They often map pretty closely to the concerns of the ViewControllers mentioned previously.

Some of the business logic that is traditionally kept in models is often enacpsulated by actions, which feel little like Service from thr Ruby world.

As a result, _models_ in Flux are simply data.

## Async actions
- [Code loadProjects]

Note:
Something that often came up when designing Stores was thinking about where the the responsibility for fetching data lied. And more generally asynchronous actions.

A default option here with a model-centric view of the world was to make this a concern of the Stores. Since they held the data, they should be responsible forfetching it.

But this lead to some problems when wanting to co-ordinate the results of these async actions across multiple stores.

It turns out, it makes a lot more sense to move these concerns out to Flux Actions, which look more and more like service methods that encpasulate a Unit Of Work.

Since multiple stores can listen to Dispatches calls from an action, it allowed simpler orchestration across dispatches. 

An example here is how the action here is able to generate a clientId when asked to create a project, and tie back to the resonse data, so that any stores holding a temporary reference to this created project are able to reconcile new data with the server.

## Http API
[Code sample]

Note:
You'll also see there a reference what we call our API, but might be better named as our Data Access layer. 

This is not something specific to React or Flux, but we've found it extremely useful to pull out all interactions with our server API into a single module. 

This relies on our own simple wrapper around super-agent for actually making the server calls, and is a useful place for cross-cutting concerns such as logging, queuing of requests.

---

## The future

Note:
I don't imagine Flux in it's current form is the final word on data in the React ecosystem. There is a lot of experimentation going on, with lot's of libraries pushing out these ideas and experimenting with immutable data types and more _reactive_ styles of dealing with data.

And of course details of Relay and GraphQL are just emerging from Facebook, which I'm sure will change things.

And I think the ember data is doing some really interesting things in this area, attempting to solve some of harder problems such as client side caching and identity maps.

Netflix have started talking about their take on the data layer in the form of Falcor, One Model Anywhere.

So I imagine we'll be rethinking our data layer again at some point, again!

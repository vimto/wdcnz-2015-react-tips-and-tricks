## Writing components


Note:
Right.
OK.

So you're all set and ready to write some components.

![wire-up](../../images/wire-up.gif)<!-- .element: width="600" -->


Note:
You've wired up you npm script to kick off your gulp task to browserify your ES6 whilst it's transformed using babel to convert your JSX?

So you can write some HTML the page?

Sweet.

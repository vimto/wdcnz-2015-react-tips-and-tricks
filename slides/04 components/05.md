### Props vs State

Note:
A common source of confusion for us initially was the diference between props and state.

This was something that tripped us up a bit when we first started writing components.

Note:
It's useful to think of props as context â€” passed into a component, and immutable by that component.

If a component needs to persist some local data as part if it's life, we can store this as mutable state in the component. 

Here you can see that the projectId passed into the Add CollaboratorOverlay is a property - it's owned by the parent, and won't be changed by the Collaborator component.

But this component _will_ show a form with an email and message field, so it needs some state to track the values if these fields.

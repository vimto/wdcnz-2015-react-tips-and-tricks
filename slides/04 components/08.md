## Synthetic Events
- Cross Platform
- Autobind `this`
- Smart delgation

Note:
React's Synthetic event system is great. It normalises events across the browser and takes care of binding scope to any handlers you attach back to the component.

And it's smart about delegation. Whilst you declare event handelers inline, behind the scenes it uses a top level listener and event delegation to keep things performant.

There are times we've had to step outside of React's built in event system and listen to the DOM directly.

Note:
One example here is binding directly to the Window's resize event so a component can adjust accordingly.

Other places we do this are in listerning for global keyboard shortcuts, which we do on the document, and for finer grained control over image loading events.

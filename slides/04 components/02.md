### Basics

Note:
So a few little things we learned as we started authoring components.

---

### JSX
![jsx](../../images/jsx.gif)<!-- .element: class="fragment" width="600" -->

Note:
There's definitely a bit of a reaction people have when they first see JSX.

Take a breath. It's OK. 

---

### It's just JavaScript.
<iframe width="1280px" style="max-width: 1280px; margin-left: -150px;" height="600px" data-src="https://facebook.github.io/react/jsx-compiler.html" />  

Note:
It takes a bit of getting used to, but it makes a lot of sense.

The first thing we tried to do was figure out a way to extract the templates back out to a separate files, which is definitely doable, but misses one of the main benefits of a component based approach - a seperation of concerns is NOT the same as a separation of technologies and having the display logic and generation co-located makes for a much nicer development flow.

### Use displayName
![use-display-name](../../images/use-display-name.png)<!-- .element: width="800" -->

Note:
Use displayName. 

It's really helpfule when debugging. It's used in Chrome Inspector you saw before, and in the performance addon I'll show you in a bit.

 You get for free if you're defining components and assigning them to a named variable. 

---

### Don't Render to `body`
![dont-render-to-body](../../images/dont-render-to-body.png)<!-- .element: width="800" -->

Note:
Don't render to body. 

This our bootstrap script that kicks the app off. 

We used to render to body, thinking in made sense for React to manage the whole page, since it was a single page app.

But we also use Googles WebFont loader which likes to add lot's of classes to the body tag, so this didn't go so well.

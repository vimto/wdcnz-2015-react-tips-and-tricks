## Everything else


Note:
So, there's a bunch of other things we do and use at Atomic that I could have talked about in more detail. But I'll whizz through them quickly now, and some of them might be useful to pick up in the Q and A afterwards.

## What the Flux?
<img src="../../images/flux.png" style="border: 0;" />

Note:
When coming from a more traditional MVC approach to React, something comes up pretty quickly is where do I store my data?  Again, another topic that's a talk all on it's own, and the source of much confusion.

Essentially, Flux is the pattern that Facebook uses internally to enforce one way data flow, which compliments React's composable view components.

It's great for being able to reason about your application, and having messages flow through single points such as the dispatcher is great for cross cutting concerns.

When we started down the path of using React, there weren't really any libraries out there, so we rolled our own given how small the pattern is.

<img src="../../images/fluxxor.svg" style="border: 0;" />

Note:
Since then, it's been become an area of intense development, with plenty of Flux libraries being written with their own distinct take on the core Flux pattern. 

We currently use a library called Fluxxor, which stays true to the original intent of the pattern, whilst offering some syntactic conveniances.

It does have a few shortcomings, â€” Stores are Singletons which is a bit of a pain for testing, and it wasn't really written with server rendering in mind.

# Routing

---


<img src="../../images/router.png" style="margin-top: -60px; border: 0; padding: 20px;" />

Note:
There's actually not that much to say here, apart from use react-router. We do, and it's been great. In part, because they stole some great ideas and approaches from the Ember community, who placed on emphases on a solid router abstraction.

## CSS in JS

Note:
Whilst we use SASS for our UI at Atomic, the styles that make up designs that our users create are stores as JSON, and rendered inline to React Elements.

We came to this approach to solve a different problem, which was storing being able to decompose and persist style information in simple structured format.

But it seems to be an idea that's picking up some traction in the react community, which we're definitely keeping an eye on.

<img src="../../images/css-in-js.png" style="margin-top: -60px; border: 0;" />

Note:
Christopher Chadeu who is in the React team gave a talk a few months back on the inherent problems of CSS at scale, and how some of these might be tackled by bringing CSS into JavaScript.

Whilst these aren't new ideas, it has spurred some expermentation in the community leading to a few different libraries and ideas to pop up.

Something in keeping with the "Rethinking Best Practices" ethos that the React Community seems to embrace.

This has spurned quite a bit of activity in the community with some libraries emerging proposing new ways to pull CSS into javascript.

Something interesting to pose to the THE FUTURE OF CSS panel after lunch.

### Isomorphic JavaScript
- a.k.a. Universal JavaScript
- a.k.a. Rendering on in the server

<img src="../../images/isomorphic.gif" width="400" style="border: 0;" />

Note:
So another benefit of the virtual DOM is being able to render on the server.

The general use for this is to be able to generate the HTML that represents the state of your application on the server, send it down to the client, and then have the client JavaScript take over.

Whilst the View side of this is pretty straightforward, the more challenging parts are the making the concept of Flux and Routing make sense on the server in the context of a single request/response cycle.

Amongst others, Yahoo are tackling some of these problems via their http://fluxible.io library.

Note:
We actually haven't attempted to solves these, since we have a slightly different use case where we need to generate an image of a users design, which is rendered as HTML in our Editor.

Our approach is to use our side ContainerStore and ContainerComponent which represents one page of a users design, render the component to a string on the server to generate the HTML we need, and pass this off to Phantom to create a ScreenShot.

A quick tip: renderToStaticMarkup is a useful alternative to the renderToString method to, render a react component to a string without generating the data-react attribte it uses to reconcile the DOM.

### React Native
<img src="../../images/react-native.jpg" style="width: 600px; border: 0;" />

Note:
And finally, React Native, which again could make a talk in it's own right.

For those that don't know, React Native is A FRAMEWORK FOR BUILDING NATIVE APPS USING REACT.


---

#### "_Learn Once Write Anywhere_"
<img src="../../images/react-native-code.png" style="width: 800px; border: 0;" />

Note:
It let's you you React's familiar component based API to declare and compose native UIs, which are simply wrappers around the native components themselves.

There have been a number of different approaches to using web technologies to build native UIs, which Facebook has a string history of backing, and abandoning.

So it will be interesting to see where this goes. We're certainly evaluating the potential as a technology for a companion app to Atmomic for user to be able to reviee their designs, and more interestingly as a way to let people use a browser based design tool to design native UIs.

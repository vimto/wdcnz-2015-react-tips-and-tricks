### Virtual DOM and Synthetic Events
- A fast mock DOM
- Cross browser wrapper around events
- Automatic event delegation
- Whenever state changes:
  1. Build a new DOM subtree
  2. Diff it with the old one
  3. Compute a miminum set of DOM mutations
  4. Batch executes them

Note:
- A fast, internal mock DOM 
- Cross-browser wrapper around the native events
- On every update, it:
  1. Builds a new DOM substree
  2. Diffs it with the old one
  3. Computes a miminum set of DOM mutations
  4. Batch executes them

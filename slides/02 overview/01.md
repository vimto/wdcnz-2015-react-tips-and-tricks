### Components
- Components === Logic (JS) + Template (JSX)
- Instantiated with props
- Manage their own state
- `render` HTML to a virtual DOM using JSX

Note:
The core building in React is a Component, which is somewhat analogous to Controllers and Views (Or Views and Templates) depending how you see MVC. 

Components are instantiated with properties, and store and manipulate state. They define a render method which generates HTML and other components using JSX. They also contain the logic for responding to events.

React is initialized by rendering a top level component into a HTML element. React manages the DOM from this point down, re-rendering with every change via it's Virtual DOM.

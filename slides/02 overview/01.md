## React in 2 minutes
- A Javascript Library for building user interfaces
- DOM generation (JSX) + Logic (JS) = Components
- You _Render_ a top level component to a DOM element
- React manages the DOM from this point down
- Re-render the whole app on every change
- Made fast by a Virtual Dom and Synthetic Events

Note:
React is A Javascript Library for building user interfaces. 

It's core building block are Components, which are somewhat analogous to Controllers and Views (Or Views + Templates if you're coming from Backbone) in an MVC approach. 

These components are instantiated with properties, and store and manipulate state. They define a render method which generates HTML and other nested components using JSX. They also contain the presentaion logic for responding to events and triggering changes to state.

React is integrated into a HTML page by rendering a top level component into a HTML element. React essentually manages the DOM from this point down, re-rendering with every change via it's Virtual DOM.

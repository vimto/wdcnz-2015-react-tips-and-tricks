### Components
- Components === Logic (JS) + Markup (JSX)
- Instantiated with `props`
- Manage their own `state`
- `render` markup to a Virtual DOM using JSX

Note:
The core building in React is a Component, which consist of Logic, and Markup in form of JSX.

Components are instantiated with properties, and store and manipulate state.

They define a render method which generates markup and other components using JSX for React to render to it's virtual DOM.

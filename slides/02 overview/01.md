## React in 2 minutes
- A JS Library for building user interfaces<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Components === Template (JSX) + Logic (JS)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
-   Render a top level component to a DOM element<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- React manages the DOM from this point down<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Re-render the whole app on every change<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Made fast by a Virtual Dom and Synthetic Events<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
React is A Javascript Library for building user interfaces. 

It's core building block are Components, which are somewhat analogous to Controllers and Views (Or Views + Templates if you're coming from Backbone) in an MVC approach. 

These components are instantiated with properties, and store and manipulate state. They define a render method which generates HTML and other nested components using JSX. They also contain the presentaion logic for responding to events and triggering changes to state.

React is integrated into a HTML page by rendering a top level component into a HTML element. React essentually manages the DOM from this point down, re-rendering with every change via it's Virtual DOM.

## Why React?
- Simple
- Declarative
- Composable
- Testable
- Fast

Note:
It's a nice simple API with a pretty small surface are that's easy to learn. 

A declarative approach which makes it easier to reason about the state of your application.

A baked in model for composability that scales really well, and seems to go-with-the-grain of web technologies.

All if this makes it very testable, and pretty fast out of the box, and has some nice points at which to tune performance.

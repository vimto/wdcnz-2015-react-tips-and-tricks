# Why React?
- Simple
- Declarative
- Composable
- Testable
- Fast

(facebook.github.io/react/docs/why-react.html)

Note:
It's a nice simple API with a pretty small surface are that's easy to learn. 

A declarative approach which makes it easier to reason about the state of your application.

A baked in model for composability that scales really well, and seems to go-with-the-grain of web technologies.

It's pretty fast out of the box, and has some nice points at which to tune performance.

# AddOns and Browser plugins
- http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/addons.html
- React Developer Tools
- React Hot Loader

Note:
In addition to the main library, React features a number of extentions and utilities which are well worth checking out. I'll be covering a couple of them we use later on.

There's a great Chrome Plugin which allows you to inspect your React component hierarchy including properties and state.

I've also heard good things about the React Hot Loader, which allows you to live-edit components on a page whilst persisting state.

## Why React?
- Simple
- Declarative
- Composable
- Testable
- Fast

Note:
It seemed to offer a sweet spot, with just enough structure and composability to allow you build large and complex apps, and the right control of perfomance. So I decided to dive in and start building.


- Simple API with small surface area
- A declarative approach, easier to scale structurally
- Composability baked in
- Testable
- Good out of the box performance

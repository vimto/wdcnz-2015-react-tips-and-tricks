## How we use React at Atomic
## Building an Atomic Reactor

Note:
As I started putting together this talk a panic-inducing week ago, I realised that the tips & tricks I had in mind might not apply to everyone, and in fact might be catches and traps for some. So I figured a better way to frame the talk was How We Use React At Atomic, which is where I work. So for the first part of the talk, I'll walk you through how we use React at Atomic, and then we'll get Alex and Ross who I work with on the stage for a bit of a Q and A.

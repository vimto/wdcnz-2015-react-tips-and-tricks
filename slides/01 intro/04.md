## Prologue
> Rethinking best practices

Note:
So at the time we founded Atomic at the start of 2013, I'd had lot's of experience with Backbone, and the potential problems of how that scaled. I'd also recently spent a bit of time working with Angular. I really enjoyed coming to a framework like that allowed you to work at a higher level of abstraction by way of directives, and offered two way binding built in.

But when thinking about building a large scale app I had concerns about how it might scale, in terms of performance, structure, and it's somewhat magoc $scope variable.

The first thing we did was build a prototype of the app, for which we chose Backbone which allowed us to retain control at a lower level. Around the time we were reaching the end of this, I heard about it React. I did a bit of research, and a video of a presentation by Pete Hunt called "Rethinking best practices" really made things click.

It seemed to offer a sweet spot, with just enough structure and composability to allow you build large and complex apps, and the right control of perfomance. So I decided to dive in and start building.

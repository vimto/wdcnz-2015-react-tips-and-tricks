> Rethinking best practices

Note:
So at the time we started building Atomic early last year, I'd had lot's of experience with Backbone, and seen the potential problems of how that scaled. 

I'd also spent some time working with Angular. I enjoyed working with at  a higher level of abstraction via Directives, and thought the two way binding was pretty neat.

But when thinking about building a large and complex app I had concerns about how it might scale, in terms of performance and structure.

Around this time, I started hearing great things about React. I did some digging, and it was a video by Pete Hunt called "Rethinking best practices" really made things click.
